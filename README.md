# Fitness Buddy

## Project Proposal

Team Pineapple

Currently, there are many fitness tracker apps available on the market. These apps help users gather and organize data about their workouts and diets. However, the main issues about current fitness tracker apps are that most of these apps require users to pay for membership or for the number of features they use; or they have very limited features and does not meet user’s fitness needs. 

To solve this common issue, our application, FitnessBuddy, is an application that offers the users many of the popular features of fitness tracker apps for free. These features include: workout recommendations; database of exercises that the user has done and calculation of calories for each exercise; tracking the amount of sleep users get; finding gyms near the user using Google Maps’ API; nutritional facts using USDA’s food database API; and getting workout advice from the admins of the app. 

Our application makes life easier as it consolidates multiple features of different fitness apps into one for free. This way, users will not have to use multiple apps to meet their fitness needs. Our target audience for our application is anyone who is doing fitness or has intent to go to the gym.
	
A typical activities of a regular user of our site would be: logging their fitness goals, logging their weight for the day to see their progress, logging their workout and track the calories they burned, finding gyms near their current location, and tracking the amount of sleep they get. Additionally, typical activities of admins would be: using an algorithm to sort users based on their attributes (such as fitness intensity), and using this data to give users feedback, advice, or recommended them several workouts.
